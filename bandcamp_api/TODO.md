    - when on the merch page, clicking on the merch brings you to the album page, search for the title of the merch, then get info
- Artist Community
    - Get community posts and things with community posts
        - didnt do it cause it seemed small
        - Have to find an artist that uses community posts and has an active community interaction
- Artist Subscription
    - Im pretty sure artists also have subscriptions
- Label profile picture
- Get Bandcamp Daily tracks from the body
    - The tracks cannot be scraped
    - they are rendered by js
